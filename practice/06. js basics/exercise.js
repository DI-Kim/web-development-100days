// This is how a comment is added to JavaScript
// Comments are not executed - they are just there to provide extra
// information to you or other developers

// Exercise Time!

// 1) Create three new variables:
//    - A variable that stores the name of an online course of your choice
//    - A variable that stores the price of that course
//    - A variable that stores the three main goals that you have, when taking this course
const courseName = "100days Challenge";
const coursePrice = 15000;
const courseGoals = ["Understanding web system", "Learn basic JS", "Finish until 5/1"];

// 2) Output ("alert") the three variable values
console.log(courseName);
console.log(coursePrice);
console.log(courseGoals);

// 3) Try "grouping" the three variables together and still output their values thereafter
const onlineCourse = {
  name: "100days Challenge",
  price: coursePrice,
  goals: ["Understanding web system", "Learn basic JS", "Finish until 5/1"],
};

console.log(onlineCourse.name);
console.log(onlineCourse.price);
console.log(onlineCourse.goals);

// 4) Also output the second element in your "main goals" variable
console.log(courseGoals[0]);
console.log(onlineCourse.goals[1]);

// 5) Add a custom command that does the following:
//    - Use your "main goals" variable and access an element by its identifier
//    - The concrete identifier value should be dynamic / flexible
//      (i.e. the command can be executed for different identifier)
//    - The "main goals" variable should also be dynamic: The command should work
//      with ANY list of values
//    - The custom command should provide the accessed value (i.e. the list element)
function getListItem(array, arrayIndex) {
  return array[arrayIndex];
}

// 6) Execute your custom command from (5) and output ("alert") the result

console.log(getListItem(courseGoals, 2));

console.log("exercise.js finishâœ…");
console.log("");
